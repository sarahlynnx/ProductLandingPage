Welcome to my Product Landing Page project, a showcase of my web development skills using a modern tech stack including React, Bootstrap, JavaScript, RESTful API, JSON, CSS, and HTML. This dynamic landing page features:

- Dynamic Content Rendering: Automatically updates product information, images, and styles to match the product.
- FAQ Section: Implemented using Bootstrap accordion for an organized and user-friendly experience.
- Enhanced User Interaction: Utilizes tools like react-swipeable, react-scrollspy-nav, react-slick, and slick-carousel to ensure smooth and intuitive user interactions.
- Responsive Design: Ensures the page looks great on all devices, providing an optimal user experience across different screen sizes.
