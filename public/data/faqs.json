        "question": "What percentage is the chocolate in your dark chocolate flavors?",
        "answer": "It is 64% chocolate, but because we use a relatively small ratio of chocolate to quinoa, the sugar per serving is much lower than you would find in a typical dark chocolate product that is 64% chocolate. In fact, one serving of our Dark Chocolate & Sea Salt Crisps only has 6g of sugar."

    {
        "question": "Is your product vegan?",
        "answer": "No, it is not certified vegan, but we use all plant-based ingredients in our dark chocolate flavors. The reason our products are not certified vegan is because we use cane sugar and cannot verify that the cane sugar is not processed with bone char."

        "question": "Where is the quinoa from?",
        "answer": "We source our quinoa from Bolivia, the United States, and Canada."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the quinoa crisped?",
        "answer": "It is not crisped using any oil or other ingredients. It is cooked at high temperatures and toasted, not extruded. Because we do not extrude our quinoa, we preserve a great deal of the fiber, protein, and nutrients, as compared to similarly crisped products."

        "question": "Are your products certified kosher?",
        "answer": "Yes, our products are Kosher-certified (OU-D). They are certified OU-Dairy because our dark chocolate flavors and milk chocolate flavors are produced on shared equipment."

    {
        "question": "Are your dark chocolate flavors dairy free?",
        "answer": "Yes, our dark chocolate flavors are dairy free. However, they do run on the same lines as our milk chocolate flavors. We are extremely careful about cleaning in between changing from milk chocolate to dark chocolate. We also test for milk proteins whenever we change flavors. However, there is still the possibility of a trace amount of cross contamination."
